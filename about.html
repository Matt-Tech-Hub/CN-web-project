                <p>We used Python to start out with. As a backend programming language, it can be a lot to take in when you're starting out. It's very easy to do things incorrectly, and so the learning curve can be quite steep. The upside at least, is that when you make a mistake, there's a very good chance that you will be told where and how you've messed up.</p>

                <p>At the end of the first week, we were organized into groups, and were tasked with working together on a project. Our goal was to create a text-based game, using all the knowledge we had learned so far. I have to admit, this was my favourite part. The team and I were still novices at our craft, but we had amazing synergy, and strong determination. You can find the game on my Github or on the GAME page.</p>

                <p>The final step. I was tasked with creating this very website you see before you. It's not perfect, but I understand why so many people enjoy doing it. It allows you to flex your creativity, but without having a good structure to work from, you may find you run into problems. Overall, HTML and CSS are built to be simple to use, and it's not hard to get something basic that works. It's fun!
